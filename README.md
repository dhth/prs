</p>

ü§î Motivation
---

For my day job as a tech lead, I need to stay updated on several PRs, and my
hope is that `prs` will let me do that faster than the Github web UI (or other
tools for that matter).

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/prs
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/prs@latest
```

Or get the binaries directly from a [release][3]. Read more about verifying the
authenticity of released artifacts [here](#verifying-release-artifacts).

üõ†Ô∏è Pre-requisites
---

- [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli)


üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
---

Create a configuration file that looks like the following. By default `prs` will
look for this file at `~/.config/prs/prs.yml`.

```yaml
pr-count: 20
query: 'is: pr repo:neovim/neovim is:open label:lua'
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

`prs` has four modes:

- "Query" mode (default): lets you search PRs based on a query you provide (based
  on github's [search
  syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests))
- "Repos" mode: lets you see PRs for a repo from a predefined list
- "Author" mode: shows open PRs you've authored
- "Reviewer" mode: shows open PRs that are awaiting a review from you

### Query Mode

```bash
prs
prs --query='type:pr repo:neovim/neovim is:open label:treesitter'
```

Or configure `prs`' YAML configuration file as follows:

```yaml
query: 'is: pr repo:neovim/neovim is:open label:lua'
```

### Repos Mode

Configure `prs`' YAML configuration file as follows:

```yaml
sources:
- owner: owner
  repos:
    - name: repo-a
    - name: repo-b
    - name: repo-c
```

```bash
prs --mode=repos
```

### Author/Reviewer Mode

```bash
prs --mode=author
prs --mode=reviewer
```

### Other settings

`prs`' config file also accepts the following settings:

```yaml
diff-pager: delta
pr-count: 20
```

You can also set up multiple config files, and reference them via the
`--config-file` flag.

### üîê Verifying release artifacts

In case you get the `prs` binary directly from a [release][3], you may want to
verify its authenticity. Checksums are applied to all released artifacts, and
the resulting checksum file is signed using
[cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/).

Steps to verify (replace the version in the commands listed with the one you
want):

1. Download the following files from the release:

   - prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt
   - prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt.pem
   - prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt \
   --certificate prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt.pem \
   --signature prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt.sig \
   --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/dhth/prs/\.github/workflows/.+' \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
   ```

3. Download the compressed archive you want, and validate its checksum:

   ```shell
   curl -sSLO https://github.com/dhth/prs/releases/download/v0.3.0/prs_0.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c prs_0.3.0_checksums.txt
   ```

3. If checksum validation goes through, uncompress the archive:

   ```shell
   tar -xzf prs_0.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ./prs
   # profit!
   ```
