# prs

‚ú® Overview
---

`prs` lets you stay updated on the PRs you care about without leaving the
terminal.

*`prs` is not a replacement of [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli), or the Github
web UI itself, it simply allows you to get to the updates you care about in
fewer key presses.*

ü§î Motivation
---

For my day job as a tech lead, I need to stay updated on several PRs, and my
hope is that `prs` will let me do that faster than the Github web UI (or other
tools for that matter).

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/prs
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/prs@latest
```

üõ†Ô∏è Pre-requisites
---

- [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli)


üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
---

Create a configuration file that looks like the following. By default `prs` will
look for this file at `~/.config/prs/prs.yml`.

```yaml
diff-pager: delta
pr-count: 20
sources:
- owner: owner
  repos:
    - name: repo-a
    - name: repo-b
    - name: repo-c
```

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

```bash
prs
prs -config-file /path/to/config.yml
```
