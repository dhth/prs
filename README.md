ü§î Motivation
---

For my day job as a tech lead, I need to stay updated on several PRs, and my
hope is that `prs` will let me do that faster than the Github web UI (or other
tools for that matter).

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/prs
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/prs@latest
```

Or get the binaries directly from a [release][3]. Read more about verifying the
authenticity of released artifacts [here](#-verifying-release-artifacts).

üîë Authentication
---

You can have `prs` make authenticated calls to GitHub on your behalf in either
of two ways:

- Have an authenticated instance of [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) available
    (recommended).
- Provide a valid Github token via $GH_TOKEN.

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

`prs` has two modes:

- "Query" mode (default): lets you search PRs based on a query you provide (based
  on github's [search
  syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests))
- "Repos" mode: let you pick a repository from a predefined list

### Query Mode

```shell
prs --query='type:pr repo:neovim/neovim state:open label:lua linked:issue'

# view open PRs where you're the author
prs -q 'type:pr author:@me state:open'

# view open PRs where a review has been requested from you
PRS_QUERY='type:pr user-review-requested:@me state:open' prs

# read query from prs' config file
prs
```

### Repos Mode

```shell
prs --mode=repos --repos='dhth/prs,dhth/omm,dhth/hours'

PRS_REPOS='dhth/prs,dhth/omm,dhth/hours' prs --mode=repos

# read repos from prs' config file
prs -m repos
```

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
---

`prs` accepts configuration from any of the following:

- Command line flags (run `prs -h` for details)
- Environment variables (eg. `PRS_QUERY`)
- `prs`'s config file, which looks like this:

    ```yaml
    num: 20
    repos:
      - dhth/omm
      - dhth/hours
      - dhth/prs
      - neovim/neovim
      - junegunn/fzf
      - BurntSushi/ripgrep
      - charmbracelet/bubbletea
      - goreleaser/goreleaser
      - dandavison/delta
    query: 'type:pr repo:neovim/neovim state:open label:lua linked:issue'
    ```

For every configuration property, the order of priority is: `flag >>
environment variables >> config file`, ie, flags take the highest priority.

### üîê Verifying release artifacts

In case you get the `prs` binary directly from a [release][3], you may want to
verify its authenticity. Checksums are applied to all released artifacts, and
the resulting checksum file is signed using
[cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/).

Steps to verify (replace the version in the commands listed with the one you
want):

1. Download the following files from the release:

   - prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt
   - prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt.pem
   - prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt \
   --certificate prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt.pem \
   --signature prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt.sig \
   --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/dhth/prs/\.github/workflows/.+' \
   --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
   ```

3. Download the compressed archive you want, and validate its checksum:

   ```shell
   curl -sSLO https://github.com/dhth/prs/releases/download/v1.0.0/prs_1.0.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c prs_1.0.0_checksums.txt
   ```

3. If checksum validation goes through, uncompress the archive:

   ```shell
   tar -xzf prs_1.0.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ./prs
   # profit!
   ```
